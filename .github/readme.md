# Acorn

A Discord client based on my work on [ArmCord](https://github.com/armcord/armcord)

## Intent

To be an okay client mod, although features will be more opinionated.

## History

For a while, I wanted to rewrite ArmCord internals to be cleaner, but it was just a monumental task - might as well start over.

I had thought about doing this on and off, and came up with a name - "Acord" which eventually transformed into just "Acorn"

ArmCord was later DMCA'd by ARM Holdings (The processor company) because in the readme it was listed as "Arm Compatible"

Funny thing is, [ARM used to stand for Acorn RISC Machine...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_Holdings#Name) Funny coincidence.
